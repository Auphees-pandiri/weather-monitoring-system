# weather-monitoring-system
A weather station is a facility equipped with high tech instruments for predicting future weather phenomenon. This is also used to study the climate of that area. The measurements taken from the station include temperature, humidity and air quality. The accuracy predicted by these weather stations is not too high to predict the actual weather condition for a particular area. The error difference may be around 10% which makes a huge difference. Plus, in every city there are 23 weather stations only for predicting weather of an area as wide as 426km sq. The weather stations give the prediction for the whole city and not just a particular area. Each area might have different climate since the weather depends on location. To know the weather conditions of our surroundings I developed this weather monitoring system.
